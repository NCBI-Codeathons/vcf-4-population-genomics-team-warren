## NSPs.csv
Dataset consisting of the defining mutations affecting the following genes:  ORF1b, ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF8. This dataset was extracted from the first sheet of the file LTI_mutations.xlsx.

## Spike.csv
Dataset consisting of the defining mutations affecting the genes encoding for the S protein. This dataset was extracted from the second sheet of the file LTI_mutations.xlsx.

## N.csv
Dataset consisting of the defining mutations affecting the genes encoding for the N protein. This dataset was extracted from the third sheet of the file LTI_mutations.xlsx.

## E.csv
Dataset consisting of the defining mutations affecting the genes encoding for the E protein. This dataset was extracted from the fourth sheet of the file LTI_mutations.xlsx.

## M.csv
Dataset consisting of the defining mutations affecting the genes encoding for the M protein. This dataset was extracted from the fifth sheet of the file LTI_mutations.xlsx.
